# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | To keep track of our projects/content and not have a single point of failure, say if a hard drive crashes. Also so we can work better in teams and it allows multiple developers to work on a project |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | To make a new directory|

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | They are used to define a special "state" of an element such as hover  |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | Specificity will determine which class rule takes precedence. You can use it to make sure that a class you want to have priority does not inherit other attributes your trying to avoid. |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | You can't change multiple objects from one location and could have to go change multiple lines of code if something needs a change to a rule.  |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | Selector, property and value are the three components |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | A website serves as a first impression for a company/project. Seeing an amazing website can convey the message the company is trying to sell.  |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | To help architecht a website and help with accessibility |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | !00% they are worth it. There is no point in coding yourself in to a hole just to have to start over. Structure first with a design then code. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | the flex property converts an elements to have the flex property which makes all of the items within it resort to a flexible grid style systemand allows designing to fit multiple screen sizes and more |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | padding, margin, border  |
