# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > | the four pillars of oop are Abstraction,encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism|

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > | The export keyword can be used to export multiple values with named exports, while the export default keyword can be used to export a single value as the default export. |

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > | Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods together into a single unit. This makes the code more secure and easier to maintain. |

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > | Security: You can use a proxy to restrict access to properties and methods on an object. This can help to protect your data from unauthorized access. Data validation: You can use a proxy to validate data before it is set or retrieved from an object. This can help to prevent errors and ensure the integrity of your data. |

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > | class is the definition of the object. An instance of a class is a built version based on the blueprints of the class definition |

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > | 
A computed property is a property that does not store a value, but instead calculates a value based on other properties or values.

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > | The MVC pattern is a software design pattern that separates the application's concerns into three interconnected parts: the model, the view, and the controller.The model represents the application's data and business logic. The view is responsible for displaying the data to the user. The controller handles user input and updates the model accordingly. |

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > | to handle interactions/inputs from the user on the UI. |

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > | service handles business logic and any data manipulation |

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > | model is where you define your class structure |
