# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> | Inheritance allows you to reuse code and create more complex classes. It allows one class to inherit properties and behaviors of another class. |

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> | The Singleton design pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system. |

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> | The Observer design pattern is a software design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically. AKA reactivity. |

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> | The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. To be honest I don't fully understand this one but this is the most relevant data I found. |

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> | 
The Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is often used to encapsulate the creation of objects in a single class, such as a factory class. |

06. What is test driven development?

> | Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the code. Basically you write a test, run the test, write the code and refactor accordingly until it passes |

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> | The Definition of Done (DoD) is a set of criteria that determines when a piece of work is considered "done" in Scrum and Agile development. The DoD is typically agreed upon by the Scrum team, and it can vary depending on the project.  |

08. Give two examples of a user story:

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> | In Scrum, user stories are used to define the work that needs to be done in order to deliver a product increment. They are typically written by the product owner and then refined by the development team. - 1 I want to be able to see the status of my order so that I can track its progress. - 2 I want to be able to add new products to my store so that I can expand my inventory.|

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> | Per my findings tasks are assigned to team members during sprint planning  its where the team discusses the work that needs to be done in order to deliver the sprint goal|
