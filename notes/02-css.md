# CSS

for fixing image positions use **object** .fit: cover; and object.position: center;
d flex can throw off dflex columns so u can center an image inside of a column by using text-center

* if you use wrap.position: relative; you can use absolute on elements within and make sure they are always the same **position-relative** is the bootstrap class and **position-absolute** for the children

* **@media(max-width:768px){.hero-img: url(" ")}** a conditional statement that will change the image depending on screen size
